### General info
BeeSim is an exploration into how complex behavior emerges from the interaction of individually simple entities. The central goal of the
simulation is to create emergent behavior without explicitly programming it.
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pygame for rendering
### Features
- Finite State Automata form the backbone of the project, each individual bee being an independent automaton.
- Procedurally generated flower fields.
- UI elements that allow the inspection of individual hives during simulation.
- Caste system for bees, the two castes being workers and scouts
- Bees search and harvest nectar from nearby flowers
- Camera features which allow zooming in / out and shifting perspective.
### Setup
Clone the repository, install pygame if you have to and then run main.
